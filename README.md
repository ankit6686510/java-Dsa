- Operators and expressions
- Input/output handling
- Control flow (if-else, switch statements)

### Loops and Patterns
- For loops, while loops (`Loops/`)
- Various pattern printing techniques (`Pattern/`)
- Armstrong numbers, Palindrome checking
- Number series (Fibonacci, etc.)

### Arrays
- Array manipulation (`lecture_11_Arrays/`)
- Linear search
- Finding max/min elements
- Reversing arrays

### Sorting Algorithms
- Selection sort (`sorting/`)
- Insertion sort
- Cyclic sort and its applications

### Binary Search
- Binary search implementation (`Lecture_20_binary search/`)
- Search in mountain array
- Book allocation problem
- Aggressive cows problem

### Strings
- String manipulation (`Lecture_22_Strings/`)
- Palindrome detection
- Substring operations

### ArrayList and Wrapper Classes
- ArrayList usage (`Lecture_24_ArrayList_Wrapper/`)
- ArrayList traversal
- ArrayList working(for each loop )
- Auto-boxing, unboxing
- Wrapper class implementations

### Trees
- Binary trees (`Trees/`)

- Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- AVL trees
- Segment trees

### Menu-Driven Programs
- Various practical applications (`SwitchStament/`)
- Library management system
