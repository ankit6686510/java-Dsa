## Introduction

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for applications, from mobile to enterprise systems. With a focus on **DSA**, youâ€™ll learn to solve problems efficiently and build a solid foundation in Java.

---

## Java Basics

- **Hello World & Setup**: Setting up Java environment, IDEs, and writing your first program.
- **Data Types**: Primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, etc.) and non-primitive types.
- **Variables & Constants**: Declaration, initialization, and scope.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise, and assignment operators.
- **Control Statements**:
  - `if`, `if-else`, and `else-if`
  - `switch` statements
- **Loops**:
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
  - Loop control (break, continue)
- **Input & Output**:
  - Using `Scanner` for input
  - Basic output with `System.out.println`

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes & Objects**: Defining classes, creating objects, and object lifecycle.
- **Inheritance**: Single and multilevel inheritance, `super` keyword.
- **Polymorphism**: Compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
- **Encapsulation**: Using getters and setters.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Exception Handling**: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`.

## Data Structures in Java

### Basic Data Structures

1. **Arrays**:
   - Basics and memory allocation
   - Types: single-dimensional, multi-dimensional
   - Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal
1'.**Binary search**:


2. **Strings**:
   - Immutable vs. mutable strings
   - Important methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `concat()`
   - `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`

3. **ArrayLists**:
   - Usage and dynamic resizing
   - `add`, `remove`, `get`, and `set` methods

### Intermediate Data Structures

4. **Linked Lists**:
   - Singly and doubly linked lists
   - Insertions, deletions, and reversals

5. **Stacks**:
   - Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
   - Applications in expression evaluation and backtracking

6. **Queues**:
   - Basic and circular queues
   - Priority Queue and Deque

7. **Trees**:
   - Binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BST)
   - Tree traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

8. **Hashing**:
   - Hash tables and hash maps
   - Collision handling (chaining and open addressing)

### Advanced Data Structures

9. **Heaps**:
   - Min-heap and max-heap concepts
   - Heap sort and priority queue applications

10. **Graphs**:
    - Representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
    - BFS and DFS traversals
    - Applications (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, topological sort)

## Algorithms

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Heap Sort, Radix Sort

### Recursion

- Base cases and recursive calls

## Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic Programming (DP) is essential for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Topics include:

1. **Introduction to DP**:
   - Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
   - Memoization and tabulation

2. **Common DP Problems**:
   - Fibonacci series, factorial, and subset sum
   - 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
   - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
   - Coin Change, minimum path sum

3. **Advanced DP Topics**:
   - DP with bit masking
   - DP on trees
   - DP on graphs

## FAQ

### Q1: How long does it take to master Java and DSA?
A: Mastery depends on your pace and dedication. Generally, around 6-12 months of consistent practice should help you become proficient.

### Q2: Should I focus on DSA or Java first?
A: Start with Java basics to get comfortable with syntax, then move on to DSA topics. You'll pick up Java concepts along the way as you solve problems.

### Q3: Whatâ€™s the best way to improve problem-solving skills?
A: Practice regularly, understand the time and space complexity, and learn multiple solutions to each problem. Keep refining your code and approach.
