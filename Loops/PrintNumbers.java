public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {  // i starts from 1 and goes up to 10
            System.out.print(i + " ");    // Print i followed by a space
        }
    }
}
// Explanation:
// The loop starts with i = 1, and continues to execute as long as i <= 10.
// After each iteration, i is incremented by 1 (i++).
// This prints: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
